Implement Dijkstra's algorithm and Bidirectional algorithm, which search from s and t simultaneously using Dijkstra's shortest path Algorithm. 

The algorithm is written in Java, including Point.java DirectedEdge.java WeightedGraph.java Dijkstra.java
Some extra libraries are needed like stdlib.jar and algs4.jar simply for Output the result
